Fibonacci sequences. Write a method(or pseudo code), that generates the Fibonacci sequences.
Factorial a) Write a function that, given a number as input, returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a number ‘n’ is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ‘n’. So, the factorial of 6 would be 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720. The factorial of 0 is 1.
Factorial b) Write your solution with recursion.
Write a function, that print all the files in a given folder and sub-folders with using recursion.
What is “Stack overflow”? Write a code, that ends up with stack overflow.
What is binary search tree (BST)? Write an implementation in Java.
What is linked list? How to find if linked list has a loop?
How to find middle element of linked list in one pass?
In an integer array, there is 1 to 100 number, out of one is duplicate, how to find?
What is the difference between Stack and Queue data structure?
What is QuickSort? Describe the main logic of this sorting algorithm.
